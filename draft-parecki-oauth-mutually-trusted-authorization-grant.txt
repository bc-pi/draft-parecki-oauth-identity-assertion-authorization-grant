1.  Introduction

   Enterprises often have hundreds of SaaS applications.  SaaS
   applications often have integrations to other SaaS applications that
   are critical to the application experience and jobs to be done.  When
   a SaaS app needs to request an access token on-behalf of a user to a
   3rd party SaaS integration's API, the end-user needs to complete an
   interactive delegated OAuth 2.0 ceremony and consent.  The SaaS
   application is not in the same security or policy domain as the 3rd
   party SaaS integration.

   It is industry best practice for an enterprise to connect their
   ecosystem of SaaS applications to their Identity Provider (IdP) to
   centralize identity and access management capabilites for the
   organization.  End-users get a better experience (SSO) and
   administrators get better security outcomes such multi-factor
   authentication and zero-trust.  SaaS applications today enable the
   administrator to establish trust with an IdP for user authentication
   but typically don't allow the administrator to trust the IdP for API
   authorization.

   The draft specification Identity Chaining Across Trust Domains
   ([I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining]) defines how to request a JWT
   authorization grant from from an Authorization Server and exchange it
   for an Access Token at another Authorization Server.  The
   specification is an application of a combination of OAuth 2.0 Token
   Exchange [RFC8693] and JSON Web Token (JWT) Profile for OAuth 2.0
   Client Authentication and Authorization Grants [RFC7523].  The draft
   supports multiple different use cases by leaving many details of the
   token exchange request and JWT authorization grant unspecified.  This
   specification defines the additional details necessary to support
   interoperable implementations for this specific use case.

   This specification enables federation for Authorization Servers
   across policy or administrative boundaries.  The same enterprise IdP
   for example that is trusted by applications for SSO can be extended
   to broker access to APIs.  This enables the enterprise to centralize
   more access decisions across their SaaS ecosystem and provides better
   end-user experience for users that need to connect multiple
   applications via OAuth 2.0.

   This specification extends [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining],
   enabling applications to request access to 3rd party applications
   using backchannel operations that don't interupt the end user's
   interactive application experience.  Its also useful for deployments
   where SSO is based on SAML and not using OpenID Connect.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  Roles

   Client  Application that wants to obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token on
      behalf of a signed-in user to an external/3rd party application's
      API (Resource Server below) that is managed by the same enterprise
      IdP.  In [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining], this is the Client in
      trust domain A.

   Resource Application  Application that provides an OAuth 2.0
      Protected Resource that is used across an enterprise's SaaS
      ecosystem.  In [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining], this is the
      Protected Resource in trust domain B.

   Mutually-Trusted Authorization Server (IdP)  Organization's Identity
      Provider that is trusted by a set of applications in an
      enterprise's app ecosystem for identity and access management.  In
      [I-D.ietf-oauth-identity-chaining], this is the Authorization
      Server in trust domain A, which is also trusted by the
      Authorization Server of the Protected Resource in trust domain B.

3.  Overview

   The example flow is for an enterprise acme

| Role     | App URL | Tenant URL   | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Client | `https://wiki.app` | `https://acme.wiki.app` | SaaS Wiki app that embeds content from best-of-breed SaaS apps |
| Resource Application   | `https://chat.app` | `https://acme.chat.app` | SaaS chat and communication app |
| Identity Provider      | `https//idp.cloud`   | `https://acme.idp.cloud` | Cloud Identity Provider |

   1.  User logs in to the Client via SSO with the Enterprise IdP (SAML
       or OIDC)

   2.  Client requests a JWT Authorization Grant for the Resource
       Application from the IdP

   3.  Client exchanges the JWT Authorization Grant for an access token
       at the Resource Application's token endpoint

3.1.  Preconditions

   *  Client has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client with the IdP
      Authorization Server

   *  Client has a registered OAuth 2.0 Client with the Resource
      Applicaiton

   *  Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP
      and the Client for SSO and Mutually-Trusted Authorization Grant

   *  Enterprise has established a trust relationship between their IdP
      and the Resource Application for SSO and Mutually-Trusted
      Authorization Grant

   *  Enterprise has granted the Client to act on-behalf of users for
      the Resource Application with a set of scopes

4.  User Authentication

   The Client initiates an authentication request with the tenant's
   trusted Enterprise IdP using SAML or OIDC.

   The following is an example using SAML 2.0

302 Redirect
Location: https://acme.idp.cloud/SAML2/SSO/Redirect?SAMLRequest={base64AuthnRequest}&RelayState=DyXvaJtZ1BqsURRC

   The user authenticates with the IdP and post backs an assertion to
   the Client

   Note: The Enterprise IdP may enforce security controls such as multi-
   factor authentication before granting the user access to the Client.

   POST /SAML2/SSO/ACS HTTP/1.1
   Host: https://acme.wiki.app/SAML2/ACS
   Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   Content-Length: nnn

   SAMLResponse={AuthnResponse}&RelayState=DyXvaJtZ1BqsURRC

5.  Token Exchange

   The Client makes a Token Exchange [RFC8693] request to the IdP's
   Token Endpoint with the following parameters:

   *  requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:mtag

   *  resource - The token endpoint of the Resource Application.

   *  scope - The space-separated list of scopes at the Resource
      Application to include in the token

   *  subject_token - The SSO assertion (SAML or OpenID Connect ID
      Token) for the target end-user

   *  subject_token_type - For SAML2 Assertion:
      urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:saml2, or OpenID Connect ID
      Token: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:id_token

   *  Client authentication (e.g. client_id and client_secret, or the
      more secure private_key_jwt method using client_assertion and
      client_assertion_type)

   For example:

POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
Host: acme.idp.cloud
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange
&requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:mtag-jwt

5.1.  Processing Rules

   The IdP validates the subject token, and checks that the audience of
   the subject token matches the client_id of the client authentication
   of the request.

   The IdP evaluates administrator-defined policy for the token exchange
   request and determines if the application (client) should be granted
   access to act on behalf of the subject for the target audience &
   scopes.

   IdP may also introspect the authentication context described in the
   SSO assertion to determine if step-up authentication is required.

5.2.  Response

   If access is granted, the IdP will return a signed Mutually-Trusted
   Authorization Grant JWT in the token exchange response defined in
   Section 2.2 of [RFC8693]:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store
   Pragma: no-cache

   {
     "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...",
     "issued_token_type": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:mtag-jwt",
     "token_type": "N_A",
     "scope": "chat.read chat.history",
     "expires_in": 300
   }

   *  access_token - The Mutually-Trusted Authorization Grant JWT.
      Token Exchange requires the access_token response parameter for
      historical reasons, even though this is not an access token.

   *  issued_token_type - urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:mtag-jwt

   *  token_type - N_A (Required by the Token Exchange spec)

   *  scope - The list of scopes granted by the IdP.  This may be fewer
      scopes than the application requested based on various policies in
      the IdP.

   *  expires_in - The lifetime in seconds of the authorization grant.

5.2.1.  Error Response

   On an error condition, the IdP returns an OAuth 2.0 Token Error
   response as defined in Section 5.2 of [RFC6749], e.g:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   Content-Type: application/json
   Cache-Control: no-store

   {
     "error": "invalid_grant",
     "error_description": "Audience validation failed"
   }

5.3.  Mutually-Trusted Authorization Grant JWT

   The Mutually-Trusted Authorization Grant JWT is issued by the IdP
   https://acme.idp.cloud for the requested audience
   https://acme.chat.app and includes the following claims:

   *  iss - The IdP issuer URL

   *  sub - The User ID at the IdP

   *  aud - Token endpoint of the Resource Application's authorization
      server

   *  azp - Client ID as registered with the Resource Application's
      authorization server.

   *  exp -

   *  iat -

   *  scopes - Array of scopes at the Resource Application granted to
      the Client

   *  jti - Unique ID of this JWT

   The typ of the JWT indicated in the JWT header MUST be oauth-
   mtag+jwt.

   An example JWT shown with expanded header and payload claims is
   below:

   {
     "typ": "oauth-mtag+jwt"
   }
   .
   {
     "jti": "9e43f81b64a33f20116179",
     "iss": "https://acme.idp.cloud",
     "sub": "U019488227",
     "aud": "https://acme.chat.app/oauth2/token",
     "azp": "f53f191f9311af35",
     "exp": 1311281970,
     "iat": 1311280970,
     "scopes" : [ "chat.read" , "chat.history" ]
   }
   .
   signature

   Notes:

   *  If the IdP is multi-tenant, and uses the same issuer for all
      tenants, the Resource Application will already have IdP-specific
      logic to determine the tenant from OIDC/SAML (e.g. hd in Google)
      and will need to use that if the IdP also has only one client
      registration for the Resource Application

   *  sub should be an opaque ID, as iss+sub is unique.  The IdP might
      want to also include the user's email here, which it should do as
      a new email claim.  This would let the app dedupe existing users
      who may have an account with an email address but have not done
      SSO yet

6.  Access Token Request

   The Client makes an access token request to the Resource
   Application's token endpoint using the previously obtained Mutually-
   Trusted Authorization Grant as a JWT Assertion [RFC7523].

   *  grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer

   *  assertion - The JWT authorization grant obtained in the previous
      step

   *  Client Authentication - the Client authenticates with its
      credentials as registered with the Resource Application's
      authorization server

   For example:

   POST /oauth2/token HTTP/1.1
   Host: acme.chat.app
   Authorization: Basic yZS1yYW5kb20tc2VjcmV0v3JOkF0XG5Qx2

   grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer
   assertion=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsI...

6.1.  Processing Rules

   All of Section 5.2 of [RFC7521] applies, in addition to the following
   processing rules:

   *  Validate the JWT typ is oauth-mtag+jwt (per [RFC8725])

   *  The aud claim MUST identify the token endpoint of the Resource
      Application as the intended audience of the JWT.

6.2.  Response

   The Resource Application token endpoint responds with an OAuth 2.0
   Token Response, e.g.:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
   Cache-Control: no-store
   Pragma: no-cache

   {
     "token_type": "Bearer",
     "access_token": "2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
     "expires_in": 86400,
     "refresh_token": "tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA",
   }

7.  Security Considerations

7.1.  Client Authentication

   This specification SHOULD only be supported for confidential clients.
   Public clients SHOULD redirect the user with an OAuth 2.0
   Authorization Request.

7.2.  Step-Up Authentication

   In the initial token exchange request, the IdP may require step-up
   authentication for the subject if the authentication context in the
   subject's assertion does not meet policy requirements.  An
   insufficient_user_authentication OAuth error response may be returned
   to convey the authentication requirements back to the client similar
   to OAuth 2.0 Step-up Authentication Challenge Protocol
   (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9470.html)

HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json
Cache-Control: no-store

{
  "error": "insufficient_user_authentication",
  "error_description": "Subject doesn't meet authentication requirements",
  "max_age: "5"
}

   The Client would need to redirect the user back to the IdP to obtain
   a new assertion that meets the requirements and retry the token
   exchange.

   TBD: It may make more sense to request the JWT authorization grant as
   an additional response_type on the authorization request if using
   OIDC for SSO when performing a step-up to skip the need for
   additional token exchange round-trip.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  Media Types

   This section registers oauth-mtag+jwt, a new media type [RFC2046] in
   the "Media Types" registry [IANA.MediaTypes] in the manner described
   in [RFC6838].  It can be used to indicate that the content is a
   Mutually-Trusted Aauthorization Grant JWT.

8.2.  OAuth URI Registration

   This section registers urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:mtag-jwt in
   the "OAuth URI" subregistry of the "OAuth Parameters" registry
   [IANA.OAuth.Parameters].

   *  URN: urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:mtag-jwt

   *  Common Name: Token type URI for a Mutually-Trusted Authorization
      Grant JWT

   *  Change Controller: IESG

   *  Specification Document: This document
