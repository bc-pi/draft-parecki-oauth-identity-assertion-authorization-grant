1.  Introduction

   Enterprises often have hundreds of SaaS applications.  SaaS
   applications often have integrations to other SaaS applications that
   are critical to the application experience and jobs to be done.  When
   a SaaS app needs to request an access token on-behalf of a user to a
   3rd party SaaS integration's API, the end-user needs to complete an
   interactive delegated OAuth 2.0 ceremony and consent.  The SaaS
   application is not in the same security or policy domain as the 3rd
   party SaaS integration.

   It is industry best practice for an enterprise to connect their
   ecosystem of SaaS applications to their Identity Provider (IdP) to
   centralize identity and access management capabilites for the
   organization.  End-users get a better experience (SSO) and
   administrators get better security outcomes such multi-factor
   authentication and zero-trust.  SaaS applications today enable the
   administrator to establish trust with an IdP for user authentication
   but typically don't allow the administrator to trust the IdP for API
   authorization.

   The draft specification Authorization Cross Domain Code 1.0
   (https://openid.bitbucket.io/draft-acdc-01.html) (ACDC) defines a new
   JWT-based grant type that can requested from an Authorization Server
   and exchanged with another Authorization Server for Access and
   Refresh tokens.  This new grant enables federation for Authorization
   Servers across policy or administrative boundaries.  The same
   enterprise IdP for example that is trusted by applications for SSO
   can be extended to broker access to APIs.  This enables the enteprise
   to centralize more access decisions across their SaaS ecosystem and
   provides better end-user experience for users that need to connect
   multiple applications via OAuth 2.0.

   This specification extends support for the Authorization Cross-Domain
   Code (ACDC) grant to [RFC8693] requests, enabling applications to
   request access to 3rd party applications using backchannel operations
   that don't interupt the end user's interactive application
   experience.  Its also useful for deployments where SSO is SAML based
   and not using OpenID Connect.

2.1.  Roles

   Requesting Application (Client)  Application that wants to obtain an
      OAuth 2.0 access token on behalf of a signed-in user to an
      external/3rd party application's API that is managed by the same
      enterprise IdP.

   Resource Application (Resource)  Application that provides an OAuth
      2.0 Protected Resource that is used across and enterprise's SaaS
      ecosystem.

   Identity Provider (IdP)  Organization's Identity Provider that is
